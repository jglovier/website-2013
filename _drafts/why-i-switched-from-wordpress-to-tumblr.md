So about four months ago now I started a Tumblr blog. Mostly just out of curiosity to know why it has become so popular in the past year.

Well, I found out.

I’ve become quite a fan of Tumblr, and can easily see it has many advantages to blogging over Wordpress - although there are also some tradeoffs.

I’d like to share with you what I’ve found from my experience so far…
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<strong>Simplicity</strong>. Honestly, this is going to be my main point for what I’ve come to love about Tumblr, and although I do love to have points in sets of at least two or three, it will be my only point. However, I will certainly expound.
<h4>The Dashboard</h4>
Admittedly, Tumblr is missing some features that I love about Wordpress, but I’ve come to love that about Tumblr.

One of those missing features is tons of options in the dashboard.

<!--left off writing here-->
<h3>Trade Offs</h3>
- must host on Tumblr’s servers (as opposed to Wordpress self install vs Wordpress.com hosted accounts); no option for a “self hosted Tumblr”
- no way to create post categories other than the default “post-type”; would be nice to be able to categorize my text posts into a category, or even all of my posts into categories beyond just what type of content it is (video, text, photo, etc.); i suspect Tumblr will add this feature, although you can never count on speculated features
- support for subpages on a blog is a little difficult to navigate
<h3>*NOTE: Tumblr is NOT a CMS</h3>
<em>In all of this lavish love of Tumblr, let me be clear that I’m solely comparing these two web apps on the basis of use as a blogging platform.</em>

Wordpress still far exeeds any remote capability that Tumblr has to be a stand-alone site content management platform. Tumblr’s strength is Blogging, and that also happens to be it’s primary focus. It’s sort of a one-trick pony, although it performs that one trick in very impressive form.

Wordpress - on the other hand - while it started primarily as a blogging engine, has really evolved into a platform for an entire content management solution. It is still more or less unrivaled at that (that is in our WP vs Tumblr debate anyway).
